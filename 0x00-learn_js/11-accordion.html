            <div class="question">Was Alexandre Dumas black?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes, he is. Alexandre Dumas was a French novelist and playwright. His works have been translated into many languages and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of adventure were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After and The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. Since the early 20th century, his novels have been adapted into nearly 200 films. His father, General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie, was born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) to Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman, and Marie-Cessette Dumas, an African slave.

            <div class="question">Is it true that there was a black samurai?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Yes. His name is Yasuke. Yasuke (弥助 or 弥介) arrived in Japan in the service of an Italian Jesuit missionary. He was one of several Africans to have come with the Portuguese to Japan during the Nanban trade and is thought by some to have been the first African that Nobunaga had ever seen. Yasuke was present during the Honnō-ji Incident, the forced suicide of Nobunaga at the hands of his general Akechi Mitsuhide on 21 June, 1582. Yasuke was likely from Mozambique; he, most likely, is a member of the Yao people, or from the more inland area of Mozambique. Yao people were just coming into contact with the Portuguese at the time, which might account for his name: that is, Yao added to the common Japanese male name suffix of suke produces Yao-suke. Yasuke was enslaved as a child and sent to India, where he was employed as a military slave or an indentured soldier, but that he likely obtained his freedom before meeting the missionary.
