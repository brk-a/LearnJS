            If you can keep your head when all about you <br/>   
                <blockqoute>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, </blockqoute><br/>  
            If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br/>
                <blockqoute>But make allowance for their doubting too;</blockqoute><br/>   
            If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br/>
                <blockqoute>Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</blockqoute><br/>
            Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br/>
                <blockqoute>And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</blockqoute><br/>
            <br/>
            If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; <br/>  
                <blockqoute>If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</blockqoute>  <br/> 
            If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br/>
                <blockqoute>And treat those two impostors just the same;</blockqoute><br/>   
            If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br/>
                <blockqoute>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</blockqoute><br/>
            Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br/>
                <blockqoute>And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</blockqoute><br/>
            
            If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br/>
                <blockqoute>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</blockqoute><br/>
            And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br/>
                <blockqoute>And never breathe a word about your loss;</blockqoute><br/>
            If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br/>
                <blockqoute>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</blockqoute><br/>   
            And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br/>
                <blockqoute>Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</blockqoute><br/>
            
            If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br/>  
                <blockqoute>Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,</blockqoute><br/>
            If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br/>
                <blockqoute>If all men count with you, but none too much;</blockqoute><br/>
            If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br/>
                <blockqoute>With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,</blockqoute><br/>   
            Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, <br/>  
                <blockqoute>And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</blockqoute><br/>
